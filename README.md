This package is a revised version of the material stepper widget. It aims to solve some scroll issues when using large sized steppers in vertical mode. It also add a feature to hide a step by tapping on it.

This package was made <b>for the need of a project</b>, and is propably not the best solution for all use cases. If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
